This project focuses on practicing SQL queries using a pizza sales database and visualizing the results using Python.

## Overview
- Practiced SQL queries on real-world scenarios like total sales, most ordered pizzas, peak order times, and revenue by category.
- Visualized insights using Python libraries: **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**.
- Covered topics such as joins, aggregation, grouping, window functions, and data analysis.

## Tools Used
- **MySQL** for querying the database
- **Python** for analysis and visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for code execution and documentation

The project helped strengthen both SQL query skills and data visualization techniques in Python.
